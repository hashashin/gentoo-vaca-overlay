    # Override the mod_pagespeed 'rewrite level'. The default level
    # "CoreFilters" uses a set of rewrite filters that are generally
    # safe for most web pages. Most sites should not need to change
    # this value and can instead fine-tune the configuration using the
    # ModPagespeedDisableFilters and ModPagespeedEnableFilters
    # directives, below. Valid values for ModPagespeedRewriteLevel are
    # PassThrough, CoreFilters and TestingCoreFilters.
    #
    # ModPagespeedRewriteLevel PassThrough

    # Explicitly disables specific filters. This is useful in
    # conjuction with ModPagespeedRewriteLevel. For instance, if one
    # of the filters in the CoreFilters needs to be disabled for a
    # site, that filter can be added to
    # ModPagespeedDisableFilters. This directive contains a
    # comma-separated list of filter names, and can be repeated.

    # ModPagespeedDisableFilters rewrite_images

    # Explicitly enables specific filters. This is useful in
    # conjuction with ModPagespeedRewriteLevel. For instance, filters
    # not included in the CoreFilters may be enabled using this
    # directive. This directive contains a comma-separated list of
    # filter names, and can be repeated.

    # ModPagespeedDomain
    # authorizes rewriting of JS, CSS, and Image files found in this
    # domain. By default only resources with the same origin as the
    # HTML file are rewritten. For example:
    #
    #   ModPagespeedDomain cdn.myhost.com
    #
    # This will allow resources found on http://cdn.myhost.com to be
    # rewritten in addition to those in the same domain as the HTML.
    #
    # Wildcards (* and ?) are allowed in the domain specification. Be
    # careful when using them as if you rewrite domains that do not
    # send you traffic, then the site receiving the traffic will not
    # know how to serve the rewritten content.

    # When Apache is set up as a browser proxy, mod_pagespeed can record
    # web-sites as they are requested, so that an image of the web is built up
    # in the directory of the proxy administrator's choosing.  When ReadOnly is
    # on, only files already present in the SlurpDirectory are served by the
    # proxy.

    # The maximum URL size is generally limited to about 2k characters
    # due to IE: See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/208427/EN-US.
    # Apache servers by default impose a further limitation of about
    # 250 characters per URL segment (text between slashes).
    # mod_pagespeed circumvents this limitation, but if you employ
    # proxy servers in your path you may need to re-impose it by
    # overriding the setting here.  The default setting is 1024
    # characters.
